          PREAMBLE
          </b>
          <br><br>
          The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
          development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
          efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
          open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
          with others.
          <br><br>
          The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
          redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
          fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
          redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
          names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
          however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
          requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
          to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

          DEFINITIONS
          </b>
          <br><br>
          "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
          Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
          include source files, build scripts and documentation.
          <br><br>
          "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
          copyright statement(s).
          <br><br>
          "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
          distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
          <br><br>
          "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
          or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
          Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
          new environment.
          <br><br>
          "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
          writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
          <br><br>
          <b>
          PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
          </b>
          <br><br>
          Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
          a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
          redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
          Software, subject to the following conditions:
          <br><br>
          1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
          in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
          <br><br>
          2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
          redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
          contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
          included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
          in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
          binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
          <br><br>
          3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
          Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
          Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
          presented to the users.
          <br><br>
          4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
          Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
          Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
          Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
          permission.
          <br><br>
          5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
          must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
          distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
          remain under this license does not apply to any document created
          using the Font Software.

          TERMINATION
          </b>
          <br><br>
          This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
          not met.

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

            Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
            <br><br>
            Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
            conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
            original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
            and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
            following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
            exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
            <br><br>
                Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
                intended for use by those authorized to give the public
                permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
                copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
                irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
                and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
                Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
                material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
                material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
                licensed material, or material used under an exception or
                limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
              wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
              <br><br>
                Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
                licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
                licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
                the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
                example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
                copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
                licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
                other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                the licensed material may still be restricted for other
                reasons, including because others have copyright or other
                rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
                such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
                Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

                  1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,

                      <br><br>
                  3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section

                        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                          any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                          apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                          Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the

                          <br><br>

                      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected

                      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to

                      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                      Rights, but not otherwise.
                      <br><br>
                  2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                      Public License.

                  3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                      reserves any right to collect such royalties.

                      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
